So I thought it was time to try this whole blogging thing again. In the past, getting started with a blog has always been a bit of a pain. As a programmer, I like doing things myself and tweaking stuff and understanding how stuff works, and using free hosted WordPress or Tumblr sites just doesn't fit the bill. So this time I'm trying [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and it's pretty cool so far.

I'm also using a locally hosted version of [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io) as a Markdown editor, hooked up to my Github account with OAuth so I can pull posts directly into it for editing. Shame there's no way to push directly back there, but one step at a time:)

This blog will hopefully fill up over time with game development related ramblings. I currently work at a small game dev company called [BatCat Games](www.batcatgames.com) where we're working on a 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up called Honourbound, and there's a bunch of posts I want to write around that, from the design side of building an amazing combat system, to the technical side of creating 2D character physics, efficient GPU particles, and everything in between. Lets see how far I get:)
